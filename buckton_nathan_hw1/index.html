    <h1>Nathan Buckton: A Small Town Student with a Big City Heart.</h1>
    <h3>An inspiration to virtually all who meet him, Nathan Buckton grew up in the humble town of Owen Sound, Ontario. Little did he know the greatness he was destined for.</h3>
    <h3>By the age of twelve, Nathan was not only literate, but he also knew most of his time tables. Parents, teachers, and classmates alike were stunned to see him absolutely crush multiple picture books in single settings. Not even thirteen years old, but he was already reading at an pre-school level - astounding.</h3>
    <h3>Today, Nathan can be found putting together mostly spelling-error free HTML documents to submit via github, astounding virtually everyone in this entirely non-fictional tale.</h3>
